# <font color=mediumaquamarine>Diagram Editor </font>
## Introduction:
After a month of learning Java, we were tasked with creating a diagram editor capable of editing basic shapes and PPM images within four days using the knowledge we had acquired.

Please check the YouTube video to see the functionalities I implemented:  
[**Video Demonstration**](https://youtu.be/L-HQ-lrKjQo)  

The graphical interface development was facilitated using the basic instructional library provided by the school, known as ecs100.jar. This library offers a canvas for drawing graphics, images, and text strings. Additionally, it provides functionality for responding to mouse events. Leveraging these features, I manually implemented a range of underlying GUI functionalities including element layout, button clicks, screen refresh and more.

Find the executable application (diagram.exe) from Google Drive:
